# About LegacyBoost

LegacyBoost was built by engineering leaders who've personally felt the pain of managing legacy systems while trying to maintain velocity.

## Our Story

Founded in 2023, LegacyBoost emerged from our own struggles with legacy systems at high-growth startups. After leading engineering teams through multiple failed "big rewrite" projects and watching deployment velocity slow to a crawl, we knew there had to be a better way.

We built the solution we wished we had: a tool that could accelerate legacy systems without risky rewrites, quantify technical debt, and deliver immediate value while supporting long-term modernization.

## Our Mission

We believe legacy systems shouldn't hold back innovation. Our mission is to help engineering teams transform their legacy codebase from a liability into an asset, without disrupting their business or requiring massive investment.

## Our Team

Our team combines expertise from engineering leadership roles at high-growth startups and enterprise modernization projects. We've lived the problems we're solving, and we're passionate about helping other engineering leaders overcome these challenges.
